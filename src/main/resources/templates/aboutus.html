        <h2>Shane Roach</h2>
        <p>I come from a mixed background of ecological engineering, art/design, and outdoor adventure leadership;
            which have ultimately shaped how I view the world. Over the past couple years, since I graduated from
            University.
            I have been studying art and design specifically aimed towards the entertainment industry, while also
            working at a climbing gym as a route-setter.
            Both of these roles have helped me develop my ability to create engaging, immersive, social experiences for
            people. I aim to apply these past experiences towards my career in tech.

        <h2>Kevin LaMarca</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Kevin LaMarca and I am a software engineer.
            I graduated from Baruch College with a degree in corporate communication, an amalgam of marketing, public
            relations and workplace communication.
            I worked briefly as a English foreign language teacher and then pivoted into software engineering as I
            enjoyed the mentorship of teaching,
            but longed to continue learning as a student myself. What I enjoy most in Software Engineering is the
            process of continual learning and collaborating to build cool things.
            In addition to English, I am also fluent in Italian and speak French and Spanish conversationally, allowing
            me to work well in international environments.
